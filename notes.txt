- DeepFace (DF) is complaining that IMG_8680.png doesn't contain a face. It clearly does, but maybe the empty space is messing it up or maybe it's too small. Do I need to crop it? Will I need to do that for all of the photos in the DB? That makes me think this might not be well-suited for the task I need it to do. I should watch the YT playlist linked on the GH page to see if this library can do real time face detection

- It looks like removing all of the non-face pics from the photo_dump greatly increased the capacity of DeepFace to perform facial recognition. I tested this on two images (IMG_8680 and IMG_8677). It's promising so now I need to get a bunch of pictures of people in different lighting conditions and see how well it performs. It'll also be good to see if DeepFace will work on files in folders

- It seems like connecting my USB camera to my computer and getting WSL to acknowledge its presence is harder than I expected. This YT video is one of the best leads I have so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2jOuLU4o8E
- For fun I tried connecting the webcam to my computer and accessing it in my VM and that seems to be working (/dev/video0 and video1 exist which is promising). It might be worth it to switch my development efforts over to my VM or to develop on my host machine w/o WSL
  - For the sake of posterity, I plugged in the webcam to the right-side USB port and I had to click on Devices-->USB-->VGA Camera in my VM tool    bar to attach the webcam

- It seems like the default WSL2 kernel that microsoft ships doesn't have the vhci_hcd kernel module which is something my USB camera needs to be able to attach to my Ubuntu instance. I'm going to try building a custom kernel (https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel) partly for fun and partly because I'd really prefer to keep my dev efforts in WSL. But if I can't connect even after building a custom kernel I'll probably have to succumb and start using Windows.
- Update: even before building a custom kernel I came across this GH issue (https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/issues/1010) which has a recommended fix of just manually adding the vhci_hcd module to the linux kernel. That seems to have worked! (I assume this means that I had the module downloaded but it wasn't actually registered to the kernel or something?) I'm gonna test it out to see if I can actually use the camera now.
- Key points from ChatGPT about my camera setup and WSL:
  - Your camera supports MJPEG (Motion-JPEG) and YUYV (YUYV 4:2:2) formats with resolutions like 640x480, 1280x720, and more.
  - The MJPEG format is typically better for video capture since itâ€™s compressed and reduces CPU usage.
  - This command worked for capturing a test image: ffmpeg -f v4l2 -pix_fmt mjpeg -s 640x480 -i /dev/video1 -vframes 1 test_image.jpg
